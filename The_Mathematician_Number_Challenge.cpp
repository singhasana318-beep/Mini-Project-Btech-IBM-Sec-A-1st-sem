/*Question 1: The Mathematician’s Number Challenge

Problem Story:
Riya, a young mathematician, loves playing with numbers. One day, she picks a number and wants to check two things:

Whether the number is prime or not.

Whether it is even or odd.
She wants your help to write a program that tells her both answers.
Task:
Write a program that takes an integer as input and:

Checks if it is a prime number or not.

Checks whether it is even or odd.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer — the number to check.

Output Format:
Print two lines:
First line: "Prime Number" or "Not Prime"
Second line: "Even Number" or "Odd Number"


Example 1:
Input: 7
Output:
Prime Number
Odd Number

Example 2:
Input: 10
Output:
Not Prime
Even Number*/




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, i;
    bool isPrime = true;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;

   
    if (num <= 1) {
        isPrime = false;  
    } else {
        for (i = 2; i < num ; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

 
    if (isPrime)
        cout << "Prime Number" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Not Prime" << endl;

    if (num % 2 == 0)
        cout << "Even Number";
    else
        cout << "Odd Number";

    return 0;
}
