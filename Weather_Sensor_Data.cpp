/*Problem 2: Count Positive and Negative Numbers (Weather Sensor Data)
🧩 Problem Story:

A weather station records temperature readings during the day.
Positive readings mean above 0°C, negative readings mean below 0°C, and zero means exactly 0°C.

Your job is to analyze the data and find how many readings are positive, negative, and zero.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of readings.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the readings.

🖥 Output Format:

Print three lines as shown:
Positive = x
Negative = y
Zero = z

Example 1:

Input
6
3 -2 0 7 -5 8

Output
Positive = 3
Negative = 2
Zero = 1*/
